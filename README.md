# Tribal War 2 - Bot (Obsolete, 2014 edition)

Bot orchestrating and optimizing multiple account in Tribal War 2 online game.
It manages villages, will pillage others based on their defenses and optimize gains.

The script also opens an API and allows to display a report of the progress of the bot.

I uploaded the scripts to a github repo mostly educational and archive reasons. It is not intended to be used

# Warning
The use of this bot is (probably) **forbidden by Tribal War 2**.
Moreover, it was designed for the TW2 protocol from 2014. The bot is not going to work with the current version of the game and will **likely make you banned**.

# Installation

I don't remember how to properly install it, but I suspect it only requires to install the npm packages
from the tw2-attack.js

The [tw2-attack.js] is the main script, and uses the tw2-conf.json as configuration  
The [tw-simu.js] is a tool to simulate progression (IIRC)
